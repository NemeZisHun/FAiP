Dear Dr. Bodo Grimbacher, 
Thank you very much for the suggestion and your publication list. 
FYI, until the end of the month I will be less active, as I will focus on my comprehensive exam. I am hoping it causes no inconvenience for you, nor the application process.
Thank you for your patience and your understanding!
Kr,
